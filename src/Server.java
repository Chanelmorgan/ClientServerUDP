    /*
    UDP:
    - operates on top of IP to transmit datagrams over a networks
    - connectionless meaning no end-to-end connection is formed.
    - Avoids the overhead associated with connections, error checking, and retransmission of data
    - Fast, making it useful for query response protocols such as DNS

    Threats and Vulnerabilities:
    - Lack of verification and end-to-end connection makes it vulnerable to denial-of-service attacks.
    -UPD Flood - large volumes of spoofed UDP packets sent to multiple ports on a single server
    - DNS amplification - send UDP packets with spoofed IP address, which corresponds to the IP fo the victim, toi itS
      DNS resolvers
    - DNS Port  Scan - send UDP packets to ports on a server to determine which ports are open

     UDP Packet Structure:
     - an entre packet header is only 64 bits ( 8 bits_
     - Length - length of UDP header + UDP data
     - Check sum - allows receiving devices to verify the integrity of the packet header and payload

     Source port ( 16 bits_
     Length( 16 bites)
     Destination port ( 16 bits)
     Check sum ( 16 bits)
     Data ( if any )
